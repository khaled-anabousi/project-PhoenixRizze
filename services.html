                    <p>The economic feasibility study focuses on assessing the overall economic impact of the project, not only in terms of profitability but also in terms of its contribution to the development of the local economy, providing job opportunities, and promoting growth in related sectors. This study includes analysing social and economic costs and benefits, looking at indirect returns to society and the surrounding environment. At PhoenixRizze, we provide accurate economic analysis tools, supported by reliable statistical data and predictive models that help you understand the feasibility of the project from a comprehensive economic perspective. This study enables you to highlight the economic value of your project to investors and supporting entities, which enhances its chances of funding and expanding its developmental impact.</p>

                    <p>The financial feasibility study is one of the most important types of studies, as it aims to assess the project's ability to achieve rewarding financial returns compared to the invested costs. The study includes analysing Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), capital recovery period, and breakeven point. These indicators allow investors to assess the profitability of the project and its potential financial risks. Through the PhoenixRizze platform, we provide advanced financial simulation that allows the input of multiple scenarios to analyse the impact of changes in the market or costs. This study enables you to make accurate financial decisions, carefully plan liquidity, which ensures financial stability and sustainable growth for the project.</p>
